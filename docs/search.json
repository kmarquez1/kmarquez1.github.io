    "text": "This project explores how lifestyle habits like drinking alcohol and smoking may be related to different levels of obesity. Obesity is a major health concern that can lead to serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. While many factors can affect a person’s weight, habits like drinking and smoking are common and often overlooked in discussions about health.\nI chose this topic because it connects real world health issues with data analysis. I wanted to better understand whether alcohol use or smoking are linked to obesity, and if so, how strong those connections are. This kind of information can be helpful not just for individuals who want to learn more about their own health, but also for doctors, public health professionals, or policy makers who want to support healthier communities. By using data and statistical models, this project aims to uncover patterns that can make those links clearer.\nIn this dataset, obesity is divided into seven categories: Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III. These are based on physical measurements like weight and height, similar to how BMI is used in medical setting. For example, “Normal Weight” represents a healthy range, while “Overweight Levels I and II” suggest increasing excess weight. “Obesity Types I, II, and III” indicate progressively higher degrees of obesity, with Type III being the most extreme. Understanding how behaviors like smoking and drinking appear across these categories can help reveal what role they might play in a person’s weight and overall health."

I wanted to see whether these habits are useful for predicting which obesity category a person falls into, and whether they still matter when other lifestyle variables are also considered. By analyzing these variables in full models, the project uncovers patterns that show how everyday decisions may relate to obesity risk.\nThis analysis is meant to provide insight into whether drinking and smoking are just common lifestyle factors or if they actually contribute to higher obesity risk."

    "text": "Data Description\nThe data used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and it is titled Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition. This dataset can be accessed here. It was created by researchers Fabio Palechor and Alexis de la Hoz Manotas and published around 2018. The data was collected using a web based survey where anonymous participants from Mexico, Peru and Colombia reported information about their lifestyle habits and physical conditions. Participants were between the ages of 14 and 61 and answered questions related to eating behavior, water intake, alcohol consumption, smoking and more.\nThe goal of the original study was to explore how these lifestyle factors relate to obesity. The dataset includes 2,111 observations and 17 variables. The otucome variable, NObeyesdad, classifies individuals into one of the seven categories that range from Insufficient Weight to Obesity Type III. These categories are based on physical measurements like height and weight and are structured similarly to BMI classifications.\nTo improve class balance, the researches used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) in Weka to generate 77% of the data synthetically. The remaining 23% comes from real survey responses. This approach helps ensure that all obesity categories are well represented, which can improve model performance across the full range of outcomes."

While this helps with modeling, it may not fully reflect real world variation, especially since it’s unclear which classes were originally underrepresented.\nThe data is self reported which can lead to inaccurate answers, especially on sensitive topics like smoking or drinking.\nThe dataset only includes individuals from Mexico, Peru and Colombia, so the results may not apply to other populations. There can be important factors like socioeconomic status that are also missing.\nThe dataset doesn’t define what each obesity category means, which makes interpretation more difficult."

    "text": "Modeling\nMultinomial Logistic Regression\nI started with a multinomial logistic regression model because it works well for outcomes with more than two categories. It’s also easy to interpret since it gives coefficients that show how each predictor affects the odds of being in a certain obesity category compared to a reference group. This helps me see whether alcohol (CALC)use and smoking (SMOKE) are linked to different obesity levels and how strong those links are.\nBefore fitting the model, I removed Height and Weight from the predictors to avoid overly large coefficient values that could inflate model accuracy. I then fit a multinomial logistic regression model using all remaining predictors to classify individuals into one of the seven obesity categories.\nTo understand how alcohol and smoking were associated with obesity, I extracted and filtered the model output to only show the coefficients related to SMOKE and CALC. The estimates show how much more (or less) likely someone is to be in a given category compared to the reference, based on those behaviors.\n\n# all predictors to model the 7-category outcome\nmultinom_model &lt;- multinom(NObeyesdad ~ . - Height - Weight, data = obesity_train)\n\n# weights:  161 (132 variable)\ninitial  value 3284.696332 \niter  10 value 2521.452313\niter  20 value 2055.838062\niter  30 value 1842.942856\niter  40 value 1771.136782\niter  50 value 1726.623624\niter  60 value 1708.439310\niter  70 value 1696.562854\niter  80 value 1684.548609\niter  90 value 1681.821920\niter 100 value 1672.112474\nfinal  value 1672.112474 \nstopped after 100 iterations\n\ntidy_multinom &lt;- tidy(multinom_model)\nsmoke_calc &lt;- tidy_multinom |&gt;\n  filter(term %in% c(\"SMOKEyes\", \"CALCno\", \"CALCsometimes\", \"CALCalways\"))\nsmoke_calc\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 6\n   y.level             term     estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Normal_Weight       SMOKEyes    14.8      0.651     22.8  3.85e-115\n 2 Normal_Weight       CALCno      -8.86     0.508    -17.4  4.29e- 68\n 3 Obesity_Type_I      SMOKEyes    13.4      0.752     17.9  1.74e- 71\n 4 Obesity_Type_I      CALCno      -1.37     0.578     -2.36 1.81e-  2\n 5 Obesity_Type_II     SMOKEyes    14.5      0.760     19.0  7.90e- 81\n 6 Obesity_Type_II     CALCno      -5.70     0.776     -7.34 2.14e- 13\n 7 Obesity_Type_III    SMOKEyes    11.6      1.62       7.17 7.28e- 13\n 8 Obesity_Type_III    CALCno     -28.3      3.38      -8.37 5.56e- 17\n 9 Overweight_Level_I  SMOKEyes    11.9      1.04      11.4  2.38e- 30\n10 Overweight_Level_I  CALCno      -1.28     0.578     -2.21 2.73e-  2\n11 Overweight_Level_II SMOKEyes    13.7      0.641     21.3  7.66e-101\n12 Overweight_Level_II CALCno       1.57     0.606      2.59 9.57e-  3\n\n\nThe coefficients for SMOKEyes are all positive and significant which means smoking is pretty strongly linked to higher obesity categories.

So overall, smoking seems to have a more consistent impact than alcohol.\nI used the model to predict obesity categories on the test set and created a confusion matrix to see how well the predictions matched the actual values.

You can see that Obesity Type III had 62 correct predictions and no major confusion. There was a bit more mixing between Normal Weight, Overweight Levels, and Obesity Type I, which makes sense since those groups are probably harder to tell apart based on habits. Overweight Level II was a little more difficult, it got confused the most with the Obesity Types I and II. Still, the model overall handled most categories well.\n\naccuracy(multinom_results, truth = truth, estimate = prediction)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy multiclass     0.631\n\n\nI used accuracy and a confusion matrix to evaluate how well the model performed. Accuracy is a simple and common metric that shows what proportion of the predictions were correct overall. It’s calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions. I also included a confusion matrix because accuracy alone doesn’t always show how the model did for each specific class. The confusion matrix helps me see which categories were predicted correctly and which ones the model mixed up, so I can tell if it’s doing well across all obesity levels.\nLASSO\nTo complement the multinomial regression model, I also use a LASSO model. LASSO works by shrinking the coefficients of less important predictors all the way to zero. This means it automatically removes variables that don’t contribute to much to predicting the outcome. I wanted to see if whether smoking and alcohol consumption would still be selected as important predictors after the model was simplified.\nI created the model, recipe and workflow as shown below. Categorical variables were converted into dummy variables and all numeric variables were standardized to the same scale since LASSO is sensitive to variable scaling.

I tested 25 different values to give the model a good range of penalty values to try without making the tuning process take too long and selected the final model using the one-standard-error rule, which prefers a simpler model that still performs well.\n\nset.seed(12345)\ncv_folds &lt;- vfold_cv(obesity_train, v = 5)\n\nlasso_tune &lt;- tune_grid(\n  lasso_wflow,\n  resamples = cv_folds,\n  grid = 25  # different values\n)\n\nI picked the final penalty using the one-standard-error rule, which favors a simper model that still performs well.\n\nlasso_best &lt;- lasso_tune |&gt;\n  select_by_one_std_err(penalty, desc(penalty))\nlasso_best\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   penalty .config              \n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                \n1 2.08e-10 Preprocessor1_Model01\n\n\nThe LASSO model chose a very small penalty, which means most variables were kept in the model instead of being shrunk to zero.\nI graphed the mean accuracy for each penalty value tested during cross validation.

This shows that even though LASSO simplified the model by removing some predictors, it still performed just as well when it came to predicting the obesity categories."

Most of the coefficients are close to zero, and a few are only slightly positive or negative. This suggests that neither smoking nor alcohol consumption is a strong predictor of obesity in this dataset. While smoking was kept in more categories than alcohol, the effect sizes are still small, meaning it doesn’t consistently or strongly impact the odds of being in a specific obesity group. Overall, these behaviors don’t appear to explain much variation in obesity status on their own."

    "text": "Limitations and Future Work\nOne key limitation of my model is that it doesn’t predict certain obesity categories very well. For example, in the multinomial confusion matrix, some classes like Overweight Level II were often confused with other categories. This may be because the predictors used like smoking and alcohol consumption don’t carry enough unique information to clearly separate these groups.\nAnother limitation is that I removed variables like Height and Weight and physical activity to focus just on lifestyle behaviors. While this helped isolate the effects of smoking and alcohol, it also meant that I left out some of the most predictive features, which most likely reduced model accuracy.\nFuture work could explore adding more variables such as diet, exercise and many other factors to get a fuller picture of what contributes to obesity. Also, collecting real-world data instead of using synthetically balanced datasets might offer more realistic results."
